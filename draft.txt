Input + Output + SymfonyStyle

$io->writeln()
$io->error()

$io->getErrorIO()->writeln()

In fine, stdout & stderr are just common, standard file descriptors. But in absolute, you could have
other ones (is any PHP app doing that???)

In a traditional app:

my-app | smth <- this is the stdout piped

so you want the stdout to be "consumable" to other apps.

Ideally any debug info, styling & co should be to the **stderr**.

Input {
    args/options: static data
    dynamic -> what is written to the stdin
}

```
my-app | smth <- this is the stdout piped
my-app > /dev/null <- show only stderr
logger -> devrait Ã©crire sur stderr

my-app 2> &1 -> from PHP, you don't know there is a redirection

can you handle more file descriptors in PHP?
looks like you can, need to open a file descriptor file and provide a stream to it
```
